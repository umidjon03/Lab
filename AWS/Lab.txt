Let's create CodeDeployment application

pre requested
    
    we need to create 2 roles:
    'CodeDeployRole' -> a role gives permission to CodeCommit to deploy codes into resources
    'ec2ReadsS3'     -> gives CodeDeploy agent in EC2 to read from S3

    Then create EC2 instance with 'ec2ReadsS3' role
    name: 'CodeDeploy-test'
    add tag to define environment:
        environment -> development
    open terminal of the ec2 instance and do these:
    <
    # Installing CodeDeploy Agent
    `sudo yum update`
    `sudo yum install ruby`

    # Download the agent (replace the region)
    `wget https://aws-codedeploy-eu-west-3.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/latest/install`
    `chmod +x ./install`
    `sudo ./install auto`
    `sudo service codedeploy-agent status`
    >

    Create S3 bucket 'umid-codedeploy-test' and upload the 'SampleApp_Linux.zip'
    you can take a look this folder to get the logic.
    CodeDeploy first read 'appspec.yml' and deploys according this instruction
    (It can be taken from GitHub as well)


Go to CodeDeploy console and start creating application:
    Name: DeployToEc2
    Compute platform: EC2/On-premises
        ||
        \/
    create deployment group in it:
        name: demo-dg
        service-role: CodeDeployRole
        In-place
        Amazon EC2 instances: environment -> development (deploys only into development inst`s)
            ||
            \/
        create deployment in it:
            Revision locations: s3://umid-codedeploy-test/SampleApp_Linux.zip 
                ||
                \/
                OK
    you can check the result from public ip of the ec2
