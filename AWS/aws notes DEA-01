5v in big data processing:
    Volume   - data volume (size, etc)
    Velocity - speed of data processing (real time, near real-time)
    Variety  - difference data types, sources, etc
    Veracity - trustworthiness of the data
    Value    - what we get from the data as a value in business


Data Ingestion:
    Homogeneous   - Data should be stored as it was in the source (blob objects, etc)
    Heterogeneous - Data should be transformed by dedicated engines before loading to destination

    Replayability - to process or replay data from a specific point in tim:
    Stateful      - track all past actions in a base like user sessions, so next time no need to add certain info in request as it is being stored server or db
    Stateless     - do not track past action data, every request should contain necessary info/data
